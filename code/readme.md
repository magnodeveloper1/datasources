# DataSources

You know the drill. start.spring.io, add a database driver, `spring.datasource.url`, and then you're off to the races!
but what is actually happening behind the scenes?

* configuration 
* How to configure multiple of them
* How to configure connection pool properties
* Getting them from JNDI ? (maybe show the andy wilkinson example w/ tomcat?)
* embedded datasource builder
* `AbstractRoutingDataSource`
* `LazyConnectionDataSourceProxy`
